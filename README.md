Adhera - Patient Engagement App for Weight Loss Clinics
A mobile-first platform to help weight loss patients stay on track through structured reminders, intelligent scheduling, motivational messages, and AI-powered tracking.

- Smart appointment scheduling with clinic sync
- Custom health reminders for food, water, and physical activity
- Real-time notifications for appointment updates
- AI-based calorie estimation for meal tracking
- Weekly summary generation for doctor review

Revised Core Features for V1:

Photo-based food logging with AI calorie/macro estimation
Manual entry and corrections for accuracy
Patient dashboard with nutrition trends and insights
Shareable reports patients can export for doctor visits
Basic reminders for logging meals and health goals
Simple goal setting (calorie targets, macro ratios, etc.)

Future V2 Add-ons:

Doctor dashboard access
Appointment scheduling integration
Real-time doctor-patient communication
Integration with wearables/step counters

This approach lets you nail the food tracking experience first, which is honestly the hardest part technically. Once that's solid and users love it, adding scheduling becomes a natural expansion rather than trying to solve everything at once.
Does this focused approach feel right to you? What's drawing you most to the food tracking aspect - is it the AI photo recognition challenge or the health outcomes potential?
